As a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, I'm deeply passionate about the intersection of communication, channel coding, Internet of Things, and Machine Learning. Currently, my research focuses on Human Activity Recognition systems and creating teachable interfaces that allow non-expert users to customize AI models for their specific needs. 

Prior to pursuing my PhD, I gained extensive experience as a data analysis and network performance engineer, IoT engineer, and head of an embedded system engineering team. I earned my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2015, and my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering (Communications) from the University of Tehran in 2013.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
