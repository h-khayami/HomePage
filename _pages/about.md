As a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, I'm deeply passionate about the intersection of communication, channel coding, Internet of Things, and Machine Learning. Currently, my research focuses on Human Activity Recognition systems and creating teachable interfaces that allow non-expert users to customize AI models for their specific needs. 

Prior to pursuing my PhD, I gained extensive experience as a data analysis and network performance engineer, IoT engineer, and head of an embedded system engineering team. I earned my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2015, and my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering (Communications) from the University of Tehran in 2013.
